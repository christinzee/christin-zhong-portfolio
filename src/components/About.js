        I’m all about creating intuitive, impactful web experiences. My journey
        started in customer success, where I discovered how meaningful it is to
        understand users' needs and deliver solutions that truly make a
        difference. Now, I bring that same mindset to building thoughtful,
        user-focused apps.

        I love blending frontend creativity with backend logic, writing clean,
        efficient code while making sure everything looks great and works
        seamlessly. My favorite projects are the ones that solve real problems
        and feel effortless to use.

        When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading, drawing, hitting
        the gym, or exploring new spots with my partner and dog. I’m always
        looking for new challenges and love building things that make life a
        little easier—or just more fun!
